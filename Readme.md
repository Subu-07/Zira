## About Zira

**Zira** is a lightweight PHP application framework built on principles of **clean abstraction**, **extreme flexibility**, and **minimal boilerplate**. Itâ€™s designed to give developers a solid yet featherlight foundation that adapts with evolving architecture, without locking them into rigid conventions.
- Lightweight, auto-wired DI container with attribute-based service discovery 
- Simple and fast routing system  powered by regex-based matching and handler binding.
- Minimal application kernel for clean bootstrapping, request handling, and middleware execution.
- Flexible event dispatcher that allows registering listeners and dispatching custom events.

Zira is minimal, expressive, and built for developers who need control, clarity, and clean architecture from day one.
